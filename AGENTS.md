# Fractal Boundaries

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > filid defaults — the higher source wins. Fractal Context Architecture organizes a codebase as nested independent modules: a fractal owns a contract and a public boundary; an organ is an internal compartment owned by exactly one fractal. Applies when the repository has adopted FCA — module documents or a filid configuration are present. Companions: `filid_module-documents.md` (INTENT/DETAIL contracts), `filid_verification-records.md` (verification roles and caps), `filid_code-placement.md` (where a unit belongs and how it moves).

## 1. Classification comes from files that exist

| Type            | INTENT.md | Children | Entry point  | Meaning                                   |
| --------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `fractal`       | required  | allowed  | required     | Independent module with a public contract |
| `organ`         | forbidden | files (nested dirs classify on their own) | not required | Internal compartment owned by one fractal |
| `pure-function` | optional  | none     | not required | Explicitly isolated effect-free unit      |
| `hybrid`        | optional  | allowed  | required     | Manually assigned transitional node       |

Resolve in this strict order: (1) `INTENT.md` present → fractal; (2) `DETAIL.md` present → fractal — a missing-INTENT signal; (3) double-underscore-wrapped or dot-prefixed infrastructure name → organ; (4) name in the known organ list → organ; (5) a registered adapter reports a **module** index → fractal; (6) a leaf directory with no fractal children → organ; (7) an adapter proves both statelessness and no side effects → pure-function; (8) otherwise → organ. Only module entries classify — executable, framework and manifest entries, and any `entryPointOverrides` path, feed the entry-point surface, never classification — and a leaf that never claimed isolation is an organ even when nothing in it has an effect.

- Default organ names: `components`, `utils`, `types`, `hooks`, `helpers`, `lib`, `styles`, `assets`, `constants`, `test`, `tests`, `spec`, `specs`, `fixtures`, `e2e`. Docs-as-code names (`references`, `docs`, `plans`) are deliberately absent — adding one would silently reclassify a real code module of that name. Config extends the list via `structure.additionalOrganNames`.

## 2. Classification describes; it never prescribes

Traversal continues inside organs: a nested directory with its own documents or module index is its own fractal. `hybrid` is never auto-assigned, and unproven purity stays an organ. What a node _should_ be is a rule result, not a classification: an organ consumed from outside its owner's subtree is reported with the consumer paths as evidence, never silently reclassified — which is what lets a non-FCA codebase be adopted.

## 3. A fractal is crossed through its entry point

Every fractal and hybrid has an adapter-reported module, executable, framework or manifest entry point — a package manifest that declares the public surface IS the boundary; it states a surface, it does not classify — and organs and pure-function nodes need none. An enumerated surface declares its exports by name, and widening it is a contract change; an opaque or unsupported framework surface keeps its uncertainty instead of passing. Sibling fractals import the sibling's entry point — never an internal file, and never a shared parent barrel that re-exports the sibling — while inside one fractal, files import concrete internal peers directly, not their own local entry point.

## 4. A fractal root holds documents and entry points, not code

A fractal root contains its documents, adapter-reported entry points, at most one eponymous implementation, and adapter-confirmed framework peers. Any other implementation file belongs in an organ or a child fractal, unless config grants a scoped allowed-peer override.

## 5. Organ access is judged by where the consumer sits

An organ has no entry point, so "route through the entry point" cannot apply to it.

| Consumer                   | Path                            | Verdict                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Inside the owner's subtree | organ file, directly            | allowed                            |
| Outside                    | the owner fractal's entry point | allowed — needs a retention reason |
| Outside                    | organ file, directly            | violation — unless exempted        |

- Inside the owner's subtree a nested fractal may import an organ's concrete files directly — that is the shape lowest-common-fractal placement produces.
- A unit with external consumers belongs at _their_ lowest common fractal, so staying put is a deliberate choice that carries a reason; a direct import from outside is sometimes correct — the standing case is a build whose target the entry point cannot represent — but it is declared, not assumed. Both declarations live in the owning fractal's `DETAIL.md` (entry shape in `filid_module-documents.md`). An organ consumed from outside with neither declaration is a finding that names both resolutions — promote it to a fractal, or move it to its consumers' lowest common fractal — and cites the consumer paths. The same declaration covers a fractal's internals: a consumer barred from the entry point by something the boundary cannot represent declares the exemption rather than widening the contract; undeclared, it stays a violation.
- **A verification file is not judged by this rule at all, and its references do not close a cycle.** Checking an internal unit means reaching it; the alternative exports internals for tests alone. Which files are verification comes from the adapter, not from a filename pattern.

## 6. The graph is acyclic and depth is a toll

Dependency edges point from consumers to entry points and form a DAG; a reported cycle carries its source files and resolved dependency evidence. A node stays within the configured structural depth, measured from the scanned project root over classified nodes. A pure-function node depends on no fractal or hybrid — where isolation cannot be proven, reclassify the node or pass its dependencies in as inputs. Where evidence is missing the answer is `indeterminate` — and `indeterminate` and `unsupported` are never converted to a pass.

---

**This rule is working if:** a directory's type can be predicted from its files before any tool runs, and every organ used from outside carries a declaration that says why. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the repository has not adopted FCA — then a scan names the fractals that are missing, and nothing here binds until you decide to add them.

# Module Documents

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > filid defaults — the higher source wins. INTENT records the boundary; DETAIL records the current contract and, when a change is worth remembering, the history behind it. Applies when you are creating or editing an `INTENT.md` or a `DETAIL.md`.

## 1. INTENT records the boundary; DETAIL records the contract

Two documents, two jobs — neither substitutes for the other. The section headings `Purpose`, `Conventions`, `Boundaries`, `Always do`, `Ask first` and `Never do` in INTENT — plus `Structure` and `Dependencies` only under the conditions §2 sets — and `Requirements`, `API Contracts`, `Acceptance Criteria` and `Last Updated` in DETAIL, stay in English; descriptive content follows `[filid:lang]`, defaulting to English. INTENT records only this fractal's own purpose, ownership and boundaries — never a copy of an ancestor's — and updates only when the public boundary or contract changes.

## 2. A document states what tools cannot derive

Anything a reader's tools answer in one command is not content — it is a second copy that drifts. File and directory inventories, export lists, dependency rosters and counts of any of these come from `ls`, a symbol index or the package manifest, and are never written into INTENT or DETAIL; the documents keep what no tool can print — boundary decisions, reasons, invariants, and warnings about what the tree misleads on. `Structure` and `Dependencies` are therefore conditional sections: `Structure` appears only to defuse what the tree cannot say — a name trap, a generated-vs-canonical split, a misleading conventional name; `Dependencies` appears only for a coupling the manifest cannot show. A path reference that must stay carries its reason beside it, the way an exemption does (§7); three or more path tokens in one section read as an inventory, and the scanner flags them.

## 3. INTENT is at most 50 lines and names its three boundaries

A boundary document that needs scrolling is not a boundary document. `INTENT.md` is at most 50 lines and contains `Always do`, `Ask first` and `Never do` sections — a boundary with no "never" has not been decided yet.

## 4. An organ has no INTENT

Independent documentation is a claim to an independent contract. An organ does not contain `INTENT.md`, and does not use INTENT as local documentation. If a directory genuinely needs its own boundary document, that is the signal to reclassify it as a fractal — with an entry point — not to add the file where it stands.

## 5. DETAIL's contract sections are current state, not an append-only ledger

Restructure the contract sections to the currently intended behavior on every update; a superseded clause is removed, not left standing beside its replacement. Update DETAIL before the code it describes. Acceptance groups carry stable IDs, unique within that document. `DETAIL.md` is the sole acceptance-criteria ledger; a legacy `.filid/criteria.md` is reported as such — never auto-deleted, never silently migrated.

## 6. History has one address, and the contract is not it

INTENT carries no history — no changelog, no dated notes; a retired boundary leaves by deletion, not by annotation. The code carries none either. `## History` in DETAIL is the one place the past is written down: optional, below the contract sections and above `## Last Updated`, entries newest first, recording the decision and the reason it was taken or reversed — the diff itself is version control's job. An entry that no longer informs a present decision is dropped, not archived deeper. A history entry accompanies the contract change that produced it; an edit that only appends an entry is the append-only pattern §5 rejects.

## 7. An exemption without a reason is a disabled rule in costume

`Reason` is the load-bearing field. `Boundary Exemptions` is conditional — present only when this fractal actually grants one (`## Organ Exemptions` is the same syntax under this section's former name and is still read); a fractal that needs one and has no `DETAIL.md` adds the document for this purpose. The target is an organ path or a path inside this fractal — a path names itself and everything under it. Write the target path, each consumer and the direct-import verdict inside a code span: a markdown formatter reads a bare `__tests__` as emphasis and silently corrupts the heading; the span survives the formatter, and the parser strips it before comparing. An entry uses the acceptance-group shape, so one parser reads both:

```md
## Boundary Exemptions

### `<target path>` — <short title>

- **Consumers**: <paths or globs, or `entry-point` when access is through the barrel>
- **Direct import**: `allowed` | `not allowed`
- **Reason**: <why the barrel cannot serve these consumers, or why the unit has not
  moved to its consumers' lowest common fractal>
```

A missing or empty `Reason` is an unmet contract, not a granted exemption.

---

**This rule is working if:** every fractal's boundary fits on one screen, nothing in it repeats what `ls` can print, and the only past tense in the tree sits under a `## History` heading. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the directory is an organ, or a part of the tree that has not adopted FCA — then it has no contract of its own to document, and adding one is the wrong move.

# Verification Records

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > filid defaults — the higher source wins. A verification file serves one of two roles: a spec-document is the current executable contract; a test-record is QA, regression and incident history. Applies when you are creating or editing a verification file.

## 1. Verification files hold roles, not ranks

The adapter assigns the role from the file's content, independent of its filename. Test-records are never promoted into spec-documents — a record of what once broke is not a statement of what must hold.

## 2. A spec-document holds 15 cases; a test-record holds 32 per file

The cap is per file, and it caps cases — not coverage. Project-wide test-record file and case totals are unlimited: nothing here limits how much you verify.

## 3. What cannot be counted is indeterminate, never a pass

A normal case, a skip or a todo counts as one. Statically enumerable parameter rows count by row, and a case inside a static parameterized suite multiplies by that suite's row count. A property declaration counts as one, regardless of how many trials it generates. Dynamic tables, unknown wrappers and ambiguous aliases are `indeterminate` — and `indeterminate` and `unsupported` are never converted to a pass.

## 4. Never remove coverage to meet a cap

Curate by splitting and merging, never by discarding: split test-records by behavior or by incident; organize spec-documents by non-overlapping acceptance groups. Deleting a case to get under a cap trades real verification for a green number.

## 5. Multiple spec-documents bind to distinct acceptance groups

Splitting a file must not split a contract. Sibling spec-documents must not declare overlapping contract group sets, and one acceptance group is never split across files to evade the cap. When a fractal has more than one spec-document, it has a DETAIL document, and each spec-document declares at least one existing DETAIL acceptance group through the adapter-recognized `filid:contract <group-id>` marker.

---

**This rule is working if:** every verification file's role is obvious from its content, and case counts are derivable without running anything. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the file is a throwaway probe that will never land in version control — then no cap applies, because there is no contract to keep.

# Code Placement

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > filid defaults — the higher source wins. Where a unit sits decides who may reach it: placement is a boundary decision, not a filing decision. Applies when the repository has adopted FCA and you are adding a unit with more than one consumer, or moving one; prefer the move at a natural seam, not mid-task.

## 1. Shared code sits at the lowest common fractal of its consumers

The consumers' common ancestor is the address; anything higher is a guess. Compute the lowest common fractal of the consumer owners and place the unit under it. A single-consumer internal unit defaults to an organ of that owner — one consumer is not shared code. A unit with an independent public contract becomes a child fractal instead, with its intent, detail and entry-point artifacts.

## 2. An organ cannot be a lowest common ancestor

An organ has no entry point, so it cannot own a shared boundary. When the computed ancestor is an organ, walk up to the nearest enclosing fractal and place the unit there.

## 3. No evidence for a name means a decision is required, not invented

`shared` and `common` are names that can hold anything. When no meaningful organ name is supported by the evidence, the plan sets `requiresDecision: true` and stops for a human — do not invent a grab-bag name to let the plan proceed.

## 4. Planning is read-only; the postcondition demands the exact target

A functionally working but different result is a failed restructure. The restructure tool plans and validates — a plan reports normalized absolute source and target paths, basis, consumers, the computed ancestor, required artifacts, import rewrites and decision reasons, writing only an ephemeral plan artifact; a precondition checks the snapshot hash immediately before execution; a postcondition checks the exact target, the source's absence, the node type, documents, entry point, import boundary, required rewrites and the acyclic graph — and an external actor performs the change.

## 5. The document changes before the code does

Contracts lead; implementations follow: before changing a fractal, update DETAIL, and update INTENT only when its public boundary changes. Run Filid scans and validations once at the pull-request or merge-track seam, after implementation and accepted review fixes — earlier only when explicitly requested; ordinary development checks and edits never trigger them. At the seam, record warnings as findings and note any deviation from the plan.

---

**This rule is working if:** shared units sit at an ancestor you can derive from their consumers, and DETAIL diffs precede the implementation diffs they describe. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the unit has exactly one consumer and always will — then it belongs beside that consumer, and none of this applies.

# Agent-Legible Code

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. Code is read by agents and newcomers with no tribal memory: what a file does not show, they guess. Applies when the change will land in version control.

## 1. State the invisible wiring

When behavior is bound by position, name, or registration, name the mechanism in one line at the file's entry (or its module doc): `loaded by <mechanism>; <path/name/annotation> determines <what>`.

## 2. Give every repeated block a unique anchor

In repetitive structures, order is not an address. Give each near-identical instance a distinct handle — a name, a key, or an adjacent marker unique to it; across copies (source vs generated), state which one is canonical.

## 3. Defuse name traps

When a name will mislead, rename toward the convention; when that is out of scope, post one line at the point of confusion: `entry point is <X>, not <Y>`.

## 4. Prefer the direct reference

When a direct call and an indirect mechanism are equally capable, choose direct — a reader should be able to follow the reference with plain text search. Indirection the architecture or framework demands is not yours to remove: label it (§1) and move on.

---

**This rule is working if:** edits land on the intended instance on the first attempt, and plain text search finds a feature's wiring. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the indirection you want to remove IS the framework — label it and leave it standing.

<!-- SEIRI:START:seiri_public-contract.md -->
# Public Contract

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. What a module exports is a promise to every present and future consumer. Applies when the language or module system in use has an export or visibility mechanism.

## 1. Export only what has a consumer

An export with no consumer carries a stated intent — or gets removed. Remove leftovers your change added or orphaned; leave a pre-existing one for a deliberate cleanup (`seiri_reuse-first` §3). Usage is tool-checkable; intent you must write.

## 2. Name every re-export

Wildcard re-exports hide the surface three ways: a new symbol in an internal file silently widens the contract; duplicate names across re-exported files drop silently; and text tools lose the symbol list at the boundary. Entry points list what they export, by name.

## 3. Entry points declare, internals implement

The set of symbols reachable from the entry point IS the public contract; everything behind it is free to change. An entry point holds re-exports and wiring, not implementation; consumers outside the module hold only entry-point symbols.

## 4. Framework-invoked files are entry points too

A file the framework calls by convention — routes, pages, handlers, plugin manifests — is public surface even though no import names it. Treat changes to its exported shape as contract changes, and label the convention that invokes it (`seiri_agent-legible` §1).

---

**This rule is working if:** the public surface can be enumerated by reading entry points, and removing an internal symbol breaks no consumer. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the code is a single-file script or notebook with no module boundary — there is no contract to keep small.

# Test Validity

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. A passing test is evidence only if it could have failed. Applies when the change will land in version control.

## 1. A test proves a change only by failing without it

Before finishing a fix, run its test against the pre-fix code and watch it fail for the bug's own reason — not a setup error, a wrong path, or a missing import; when the fix introduces a new symbol, the expected pre-fix failure is that symbol's absence. Use a scoped mechanism (revert locally, stash only the changed files, or a scratch worktree) — never disturb unrelated work. Refactors invert the contract: existing tests pass unmodified before and after; pin current behavior with added characterization tests before moving code — editing existing assertions is not pinning. The step-by-step procedure lives in `/seiri:implement` and `/seiri:trace-cause`.

## 2. Verify the artifact you changed, with the repository's own command

A raw-tool pass is diagnostic; the final evidence comes from this repository's designated verification, whose wrappers carry the environment, build steps and flags raw tools lack. If unsure the harness exercises your modified code rather than a stale build or an installed copy, break your change deliberately once in a unit-scoped check, watch the run go red, and revert the probe — a run that stays green is testing some other copy.

## 3. Snapshots and skips are claims you author

A snapshot captured from buggy code certifies the bug. A regenerated snapshot is an assertion: read the diff, defend every changed line, and never regenerate to turn a run green without stating why the new output is the correct output. A test that cannot run in this environment skips through the harness's own mechanism with a reason string — a bare early return or a commented-out assertion converts a missing test into a green one.

## 4. Every clause of a fix is load-bearing

For each clause, some test breaks when it is removed; a clause no test requires is untested or unnecessary. The same check applies to defensive code in module internals — a guard no internal path can reach is scope creep in a safety vest. Trust-boundary validation (public APIs, user input, external data) is exempt: exported symbols cannot enumerate their callers.

## 5. Tests are curated, not accumulated

A per-file or per-suite limit this repository declares wins. Otherwise a growing test file splits by behavior or merges duplicates into a parameterized form — and never drops a needed test for tidiness; coverage outranks curation.

---

**This rule is working if:** your tests fail before your fixes and pass after; snapshot diffs are explained; skipped tests say why. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the code is a throwaway spike that will never be committed — then remember only that a test you never saw fail proves nothing either way.

# Reuse First

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. The best code for this repository usually already exists in it. Applies when the change will land in version control.

## 1. Search first, compose second, write last

Evaluate solutions in this strict order:

1. **Reuse** existing shared code — utilities, helpers, modules already here, or libraries already installed.
2. **Extend safely** — additive only: optional parameters, new exports, wrappers. Preserve current behavior; no silent semantic change to an existing interface.
3. **Mirror the closest proven pattern** in this repository — unless it is clearly outdated or defective; then say so rather than copy it.
4. **Adopt the ecosystem-standard approach** — official documentation and maintainer guidance over ad-hoc examples.
5. **Write new code** — when the problem is genuinely novel here.

## 2. The smallest code that answers the request

Nothing speculative. Validation at trust boundaries (public APIs, user input, external data) is never speculative — exported symbols cannot enumerate their callers.

## 3. Surgical changes

Every changed line traces to the request. Remove what YOUR change orphaned; leave pre-existing dead code in place, mentioned, not buried in an unrelated diff.

---

**This rule is working if:** diffs read as direct answers to their requests, and the utility you almost wrote turns out to already exist, found. **This rule is wrong for you if:** you are scaffolding a greenfield repository — there is nothing to reuse yet; apply §2 and return here once the first patterns exist.

# Naming

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. Names are the primary index of a codebase: what search finds, what imports show, what readers guess by. Applies when the change will land in version control.

## 1. Mirror the siblings

Read the names around the new unit first — case, grammar (verb-first or noun-first), suffix, singular/plural — and match them. No siblings? The idiomatic form of the language or framework. A migration in progress? The declared target style, not the majority.

## 2. A name states one concrete responsibility

A reader predicts the content from the name alone: what the unit does or holds, never when it was added or who owns it. An honest name that needs "and" is two units; a vague honest name means a vague responsibility — fix the unit.

## 3. No grab-bags

Avoid `common`, `misc`, `util2`, `temp`, `new`, `stuff`, `extra` and their kin — they defeat search and accrete unrelated content. Three helpers for date math are `date-math`, not `helpers2`.

## 4. Derived names follow their source

Tests, specs, fixtures, and generated companions are named for what they verify or accompany, and rename with their source — a base name that matches nothing is a name trap (`seiri_agent-legible` §3).

---

**This rule is working if:** you can locate a feature by guessing its name, and new files look native to their directory. **This rule is wrong for you if:** a generator names these files — the generator's convention IS the sibling convention; configure the generator, don't fight its output.

<!-- SEIRI:START:seiri_structure.md -->
# Structure

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. Structure is the cost model of reading: every hop, level, and cycle is paid by whoever comes next. Directions only — where this repository or its architecture tooling declares concrete limits, those limits win. Applies when the change will land in version control; prefer structural moves at natural seams, not mid-task.

## 1. Dependencies form a DAG

A cycle is two units pretending to be one — no reading order exists. Extract the shared piece into a third unit, invert one edge behind an interface or event, or merge the two honestly. Trace the edges you touched; do not certify acyclicity by tooling you have not run.

## 2. Depth is a toll

Nest to expose structure, not to file things away; when following one call chain means descending many levels, flatten. A directory with one child is a corridor, not a room — collapse it.

## 3. Cohesion splits, complexity compresses

Parts of a unit that share no state or purpose are several units — split where the seams already show. A unit that branches beyond what a reader can simulate is compressed: extract steps, replace condition ladders with tables or dispatch, name the phases. Recurring growth in one file is a responsibility wanting out — split along that seam, never at an arbitrary line count.

---

**This rule is working if:** following a call chain rarely reverses direction, and splits land at seams reviewers recognize without explanation. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the tree is vendored or generated — a generator owns that structure; change the generator or leave it be (`seiri_context-efficiency` §1).

# Function Boundaries

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. A function is the smallest unit a reader can hold whole — and the cheapest one to get wrong, because the cost lands on its callers. Applies when you are writing or moving a function. Purity moves effects, it does not remove them: push effects outward until they sit in one named place, not until every layer needs a wrapper.

## 1. Inputs arrive as parameters

The signature is the full list of what a function can see. Compute from arguments; module state read at call time, ambient config, the clock, and the environment are passed in, not reached for. When a dependency genuinely cannot be passed — a framework injects it, a runtime owns it — say so at the function or its file head (`seiri_agent-legible` §1) instead of reaching through it silently.

## 2. Effects live at the edge

Pure by default; effectful on purpose, in one named place. I/O, module-state writes, and mutation of what the caller owns stay in functions whose names announce them, called from the outer layer — not sprinkled through the computation they serve. Mutating an argument is an unwritten output: return the new value, or make the mutation the function's stated purpose. A function that both computes and persists is two functions and a caller.

## 3. One file, one exported function

Name a function file for the function it exports, and export that one only (`seiri_naming` §2); a second export earns its place only when the two cannot be read apart. At most two unexported helpers may share the file, and each helper's implementation body must be 8 lines or fewer; its declaration or signature and enclosing braces do not count. A longer helper is its own file (`seiri_structure` §3). At most three types, newly defined here; derived types — aliases, narrowings, unions over what already exists — stay with their source, and type-only files are outside this budget. These counts are defaults; a budget this repository declares wins.

## 4. A helper that moves out moves down

Extraction is not relocation to the same shelf. Helpers pulled out of a function do not become its flat neighbors: give the function a directory and file them one level under it — `utils/` or `helpers/` while their only claim is "these serve the function above", renamed for the topic once the set has one (`seiri_naming` §3). The path states which function is served and which serves.

---

**This rule is working if:** tests call functions without building a world first, and the caller of a helper sits one directory up, every time. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the framework owns the unit — components, route handlers, and generated clients follow their framework's shape; apply §1 and §2 inside them and leave the file layout to the convention.

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. Context is the scarcest resource in an agent session: performance degrades as it fills, and every wasted read crowds out instructions already given. These rules bias toward fewer, deliberate reads — when genuinely disoriented, one broad read beats three wrong guesses.

## 1. Generated artifacts are search-only

Build output is not source: search it to trace a symbol, never read it wholesale, never edit it — an edit there disappears on the next build, and the deliverable for a wrong generated file is a change to its generator or template. Dependency sources and type definitions are canonical references; a lockfile is never hand-edited — change the manifest and regenerate through the package manager.

## 2. Capture once, re-read with a reason

Re-running a command to re-read its output pays twice: capture long output once to a scratch file outside the repository tree and search that file — then re-run after edits, because judging a post-fix state from a pre-fix capture is self-deception. A re-read of source needs a reason (change, external modification, genuine doubt) and a targeted range; before broad exploration, state what you are looking for, and stop once the match is confirmed to be the only candidate. Investigating flaky behavior is the legitimate reason for repeated runs.

---

**This rule is working if:** generated directories never appear in your edits, and every re-read can name its reason. **This rule is wrong for you if:** you have lost orientation — take the one broad read, reorient, and return to targeted reads.

# Code Comments

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. A comment is the one thing in a file nothing checks: no compiler reads it, no test goes red when it lies — and it is believed anyway. Applies when the change will land in version control.

## 1. A comment states the current spec, never its history

When the code changes, its comment changes in the same edit. No changelog lines, no dated notes, no "previously" or "used to", no commented-out predecessor kept for reference — nothing verifies any of it, so it rots silently and then misleads with the authority of a comment. History that must be kept goes where this repository keeps it (the version-control trail, a changelog, a decision record, a module document) — never the source. Delete the code, delete its comment with it.

## 2. An inline comment is a last resort — three lines at most, for what the code cannot say

A truer name, a smaller function, or an extracted constant beats an explanation (`seiri_naming` §2, `seiri_structure` §3), and what a declaration needs said belongs in its documentation comment (§3). A comment that must sit on the code states only what the code itself cannot — the invariant no type can express, the workaround and its external trigger, the effect that lands elsewhere — and it stays within 3 lines. What the code already shows, no comment repeats: a paraphrase of the next line is a second copy that nothing checks and the next edit orphans (§1). There is no orientation exception: a line summarizing the block below it restates what reading the block shows, and it goes.

## 3. A function's documentation comment names its parameters, its result, and its purpose

Write it in the form the language provides — JSDoc, TSDoc, a docstring, rustdoc, Javadoc — and fill every slot: what makes an argument valid, the conditions under which the call fails, the effect beyond the return value. Do not restate the signature in prose: a parameter documented as "the id" earned nothing.

## 4. Every declaration the form reaches carries one

Types, enums, fields, members, constants, modules — wherever the language's documentation form applies and its tooling would render the result, the declaration says what it is for and how it is meant to be used. A local inside a body is not one of them: when it needs explaining, a truer name or a split is the fix (§2).

## 5. Follow the language's own comment convention; do not invent one

Take the form from the language and the siblings around the file; an inline comment sits at the code it explains, not in a banner that drifts away from it. A note some other convention asks you to leave — invisible wiring, a name-trap warning, an unpassable dependency — is a comment like any other: §2 caps it and §1 keeps it current.

---

**This rule is working if:** bodies read nearly bare while every declaration the form reaches explains itself, a reader trusts a comment without checking the code against it, and the past tense lives in the history, never in the source. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the language has no documentation-comment convention and the repository has not adopted one — then §1 and §2 still bind, and the rest has no form to follow.
