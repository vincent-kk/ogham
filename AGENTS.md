# Fractal Boundaries

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > filid defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

Fractal Context Architecture organizes a codebase as nested independent modules: a fractal owns a contract and a public boundary, and an organ is an internal compartment owned by exactly one fractal. This rule governs what a directory is and how anything outside it may reach in. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: directories contain files, and files reference one another.

**Tradeoff:** routing through an entry point costs one indirection per crossing, in exchange for a boundary you can change behind. **Applies when:** the repository has adopted FCA — module documents or a filid configuration are present.

Companion rules: `filid_module-documents.md` for the INTENT and DETAIL contracts, `filid_verification-records.md` for verification roles and caps, `filid_code-placement.md` for where a unit belongs and how it moves.

## 1. Classification comes from files that exist

**What a node is comes from what is on disk, in a fixed order — not from what it ought to be.**

| Type            | INTENT.md | Children | Entry point  | Meaning                                   |
| --------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `fractal`       | required  | allowed  | required     | Independent module with a public contract |
| `organ`         | forbidden | files    | not required | Internal compartment owned by one fractal |
| `pure-function` | optional  | none     | not required | Explicitly isolated effect-free unit      |
| `hybrid`        | optional  | allowed  | required     | Manually assigned transitional node       |

- Resolve in this strict order: (1) `INTENT.md` present → fractal; (2) `DETAIL.md` present → fractal; (3) double-underscore-wrapped or dot-prefixed infrastructure name → organ; (4) directory name in the configured known organ list → organ; (5) a registered adapter reports a module index → fractal; (6) a leaf directory with no fractal children → organ; (7) an adapter proves both statelessness and no side effects → pure-function; (8) otherwise → organ.
- Step 5 reads one signal: a module index. Of the entry points an adapter reports, only a module entry classifies. An executable or framework entry, and any path injected by the config `entryPointOverrides`, never turns a directory into a fractal — overrides feed the entry-point surface, not classification. Without that split, markdown-as-implementation such as a skill document would make a directory a fractal and subject prose to rules written for code.
- Step 6 comes before purity on purpose, so `pure-function` is only ever reached by a directory that has children. A leaf compartment is an organ even when nothing in it has an effect: isolation worth naming is a claim about a module, and a leaf that never declared one has not made it.
- Step 8 is organ on purpose. A directory that declares neither a document nor an index has never claimed an independent contract. Defaulting to fractal manufactures "add a boundary document" demands and makes classification depend on incidentals — whether a directory happens to have a subdirectory, for instance.
- Default organ names are `components`, `utils`, `types`, `hooks`, `helpers`, `lib`, `styles`, `assets`, `constants`, `test`, `tests`, `spec`, `specs`, `fixtures` and `e2e`. Docs-as-code compartment names such as `references`, `docs` or `plans` are deliberately absent — shipping one here would silently reclassify a real code module of that name as an organ. Config extends this list through `structure.additionalOrganNames`.

Ask yourself: "Which step in the order decided this — and does the file it names actually exist?"

## 2. Classification describes; it never prescribes

**What a node is and what it should be are different questions with different answers.**

- Traversal continues inside organs: a nested directory with its own documents or module index is reclassified as its own fractal.
- `hybrid` is never auto-assigned. An unsupported purity analysis is not proof of purity — an unproven node stays an organ.
- What a node _should_ be is a rule result, not a classification. An organ consumed from outside its owner's subtree has an external boundary, and that is reported with the consumer paths as evidence rather than by silently reclassifying it. Keeping the two apart is what lets a non-FCA codebase be adopted: the scan names the fractals that are missing instead of assuming them.

Ask yourself: "Am I reading what the tree says, or what I wish it said?"

## 3. A fractal is crossed through its entry point

**Outside consumers hold entry-point symbols; nothing else is theirs to reach.**

- Every fractal and hybrid has an adapter-reported module, executable, or framework entry point. Organs and pure-function nodes do not need one.
- The public surface is adapter-inspectable. An enumerated surface declares its exports by name, and widening it is a contract change. An opaque or unsupported framework surface keeps its certainty instead of passing.
- Sibling fractals import the sibling's entry point — never an internal file, and never a shared parent barrel that re-exports the sibling.
- Inside one fractal, files import concrete internal peers directly, not their own local entry point.

Ask yourself: "Does this import name a boundary, or reach past one?"

## 4. A fractal root holds documents and entry points, not code

**The root states the contract; the implementation lives one level in.**

- A fractal root contains its documents, adapter-reported entry points, at most one eponymous implementation, and adapter-confirmed framework peers.
- Any other implementation file belongs in an organ or a child fractal, unless config grants a scoped allowed-peer override.

Ask yourself: "If I list this directory, can I tell the contract from the implementation?"

## 5. Organ access is judged by where the consumer sits

**An organ has no entry point, so "route through the entry point" cannot apply to it.**

| Consumer                   | Path                            | Verdict                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Inside the owner's subtree | organ file, directly            | allowed                            |
| Outside                    | the owner fractal's entry point | allowed — needs a retention reason |
| Outside                    | organ file, directly            | violation — unless exempted        |

- Inside the owner's subtree a nested fractal may import an organ's concrete files directly. That is the shape placement produces: shared code sits at the lowest common fractal of its consumers precisely so those descendants can use it.
- When the owner's entry point re-exports an organ symbol, external use is legitimate — but a unit with external consumers naturally belongs at _their_ lowest common fractal, so staying put is a deliberate choice that carries a reason.
- Direct import from outside is sometimes correct. The standing case is a bundle that must not pull in what a barrel re-exports — hook scripts, where importing the barrel drags every re-exported module into the bundle. Such an exemption is declared, not assumed, and it carries its reason.
- Both the retention reason and the direct-import exemption are declared in the owning fractal's `DETAIL.md`; the entry shape lives in `filid_module-documents.md`. An organ consumed from outside with neither is the signal that it has an external boundary — promote it to a fractal, or move it to its consumers' lowest common fractal. The finding names both resolutions and cites the consumer paths; it does not choose between them.
- The same declaration covers a fractal's internals. A consumer barred from the entry point by something the boundary cannot see — the hook bundle again — declares the exemption rather than widening the contract. Undeclared, it stays a violation.
- **A verification file is not judged by this rule at all, and its references do not close a cycle.** Verification exists to check a unit, and checking an internal unit means reaching it; the alternative is exporting internals for tests alone, which puts symbols on the public surface whose only consumer is a test. Which files are verification comes from the adapter, not from a filename pattern.

Ask yourself: "Does this consumer sit inside the owner's subtree — and if not, where is the declaration?"

## 6. The graph is acyclic and depth is a toll

**A cycle is two modules pretending to be one; a deep tree is a toll every reader pays.**

- Dependency edges point from consumers to entry points and form a DAG. A reported cycle carries its source files and resolved dependency evidence.
- A node stays within the configured structural depth, measured from the scanned project root over classified nodes.
- A pure-function node depends on no fractal or hybrid. Where isolation cannot be proven, reclassify the node or pass its dependencies in as inputs.
- Where evidence is missing the answer is `indeterminate` — an unresolved dependency that could change a cycle conclusion, or a file no adapter owns. `indeterminate` and `unsupported` are never converted to a pass.

Ask yourself: "Can I order these modules so every reference points one way — and do I have the evidence to say so?"

---

**This rule is working if:** a directory's type can be predicted from its files before any tool runs; imports name entry points rather than internals; every organ used from outside carries a declaration that says why. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the repository has not adopted FCA — then a scan names the fractals that are missing, and nothing here binds until you decide to add them.

# Module Documents

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > filid defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

A fractal's contract is written down beside its code: INTENT records the boundary, DETAIL records the current contract and — when a change is worth remembering — the history behind it. These rules define what those documents must contain to count as one. This rule rests on a property every FCA project has: a module's contract is written down in a file next to the code it governs.

**Tradeoff:** two documents per fractal to maintain, in exchange for a boundary a newcomer can read without running anything. **Applies when:** you are creating or editing an `INTENT.md` or a `DETAIL.md`.

## 1. INTENT records the boundary; DETAIL records the contract

**Two documents, two jobs — neither substitutes for the other.**

- The section headings `Purpose`, `Structure`, `Conventions`, `Boundaries`, `Always do`, `Ask first`, `Never do` and `Dependencies` in INTENT, and `Requirements`, `API Contracts`, `Acceptance Criteria` and `Last Updated` in DETAIL, stay in English. Descriptive content follows `[filid:lang]`, defaulting to English.
- INTENT records only this fractal's own purpose, ownership and boundaries — never a copy of an ancestor's. Update it only when the public boundary or contract changes.
- When a directory's conventional name misleads, say so in `Structure`.

Ask yourself: "Is this fact about the module's boundary, or about its current contract?"

## 2. INTENT is at most 50 lines and names its three boundaries

**A boundary document that needs scrolling is not a boundary document.**

- `INTENT.md` is at most 50 lines.
- It contains `Always do`, `Ask first` and `Never do` sections. A boundary with no "never" has not been decided yet.

Ask yourself: "Can a newcomer read this whole file before deciding what to touch?"

## 3. An organ has no INTENT

**Independent documentation is a claim to an independent contract.**

- An organ does not contain `INTENT.md`, and does not use INTENT as local documentation.
- If a directory genuinely needs its own boundary document, that is the signal to reclassify it as a fractal — with an entry point — not to add the file where it stands.

Ask yourself: "Does this directory want its own boundary, or does it belong inside its owner's?"

## 4. DETAIL's contract sections are current state, not an append-only ledger

**A contract that only grows stops describing anything.**

- Restructure the contract sections to the currently intended behavior on every update. A superseded clause is removed, not left standing beside its replacement.
- Update DETAIL before the code it describes.
- Acceptance groups carry stable IDs, unique within that document.
- `DETAIL.md` is the sole acceptance-criteria ledger. A legacy `.filid/criteria.md` is reported as such — never auto-deleted, never silently migrated.

Ask yourself: "Does this document describe the code as it should be now, or as it has been?"

## 5. History has one address, and the contract is not it

**Every other surface answers "what holds now"; one section answers "how it got here".**

- INTENT carries no history — no changelog, no dated notes, no record of a boundary it used to draw. It has 50 lines to state the boundary that holds today, and a retired boundary leaves by deletion, not by annotation.
- The code carries none either. A module keeps its history in the documents beside it, not in the source it describes.
- `## History` in DETAIL is the one place the past is written down. The section is optional, sits below the contract sections and above `## Last Updated`, and lists entries newest first. Record the decision and the reason it was taken or reversed — the diff itself is version control's job, not this section's.
- `## Last Updated` names the most recent change; `## History` keeps the earlier ones that are still worth carrying. An entry that no longer informs a present decision is dropped, not archived deeper.
- A history entry accompanies the contract change that produced it. An edit that only appends an entry is the append-only pattern §4 rejects.

Ask yourself: "Is this sentence what holds now, or how it came to hold — and is it in the section for that?"

## 6. An exemption without a reason is a disabled rule in costume

**`Reason` is the load-bearing field.**

- `Boundary Exemptions` is conditional: present only when this fractal actually grants one. A fractal with no exemption never carries the section, and a fractal that needs one and has no `DETAIL.md` adds the document for this purpose. `## Organ Exemptions` is the same syntax under this section's former name and is still read.
- The target is an organ path or a path inside this fractal — a consumer that cannot route through the entry point needs the same escape hatch either way. A path names itself and everything under it.
- Write the target path, each consumer and the direct-import verdict inside a code span. A markdown formatter reads a bare `__tests__` as emphasis and writes the heading back as `**tests**`, which silently points the exemption at a path that does not exist; the span is what survives the formatter, and the parser strips it before comparing. A bare value is still read, so the span costs nothing and is the safe default. `Reason` is prose and keeps its own backticks.
- An entry uses the acceptance-group shape, so one parser reads both:

```md
## Boundary Exemptions

### `<target path>` — <short title>

- **Consumers**: <paths or globs, or `entry-point` when access is through the barrel>
- **Direct import**: `allowed` | `not allowed`
- **Reason**: <why the barrel cannot serve these consumers, or why the unit has not
  moved to its consumers' lowest common fractal>
```

- A missing or empty `Reason` is an unmet contract, not a granted exemption.

Ask yourself: "Would someone who has never seen this code understand why the exemption exists?"

---

**This rule is working if:** every fractal's boundary fits on one screen; DETAIL diffs read as contract changes rather than appended notes; the only past tense in the tree sits under a `## History` heading; every exemption in the tree is explained by reading its own entry. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the directory is an organ, or a part of the tree that has not adopted FCA — then it has no contract of its own to document, and adding one is the wrong move.

# Verification Records

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > filid defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

A verification file serves one of two roles: a spec-document is the current executable contract, a test-record is QA, regression and incident history. These rules define the cap each role carries and how its cases are counted. This rule rests on a property every codebase has: verification files exist, and their cases can be counted.

**Tradeoff:** classifying and splitting verification files costs a decision per file, in exchange for a contract you can read in one sitting. **Applies when:** you are creating or editing a verification file.

## 1. Verification files hold roles, not ranks

**A test-record is not a junior spec-document waiting for promotion.**

- The adapter assigns the role from the file's content, independent of its filename.
- A `spec-document` is the current executable contract. A `test-record` is QA, regression and incident history.
- Test-records are never promoted into spec-documents. A record of what once broke is not a statement of what must hold.

Ask yourself: "Is this file stating the contract, or remembering an incident?"

## 2. A spec-document holds 15 cases; a test-record holds 32 per file

**The cap is per file, and it caps cases — not coverage.**

- A spec-document contains at most 15 semantic cases.
- A test-record contains at most 32 semantic cases per file. Project-wide test-record file and case totals are unlimited — nothing here limits how much you verify.

Ask yourself: "Am I over the cap because this file has too many cases, or because it holds two subjects?"

## 3. What cannot be counted is indeterminate, never a pass

**The counting rules are fixed; where they do not reach, the answer says so.**

- A normal case, a skip or a todo counts as one.
- Statically enumerable parameter rows count by row, and a case inside a static parameterized suite multiplies by that suite's row count.
- A property declaration counts as one, regardless of how many trials it generates.
- Dynamic tables, unknown wrappers and ambiguous aliases are `indeterminate`. `indeterminate` and `unsupported` are never converted to a pass.

Ask yourself: "Can this count be derived statically — and if not, have I said so instead of guessing?"

## 4. Never remove coverage to meet a cap

**Curate by splitting and merging; never by discarding.**

- Split test-records by behavior or by incident.
- Organize spec-documents by non-overlapping acceptance groups.
- Deleting a case to get under a cap trades real verification for a green number.

Ask yourself: "Did this file get smaller because it got organized, or because it verifies less?"

## 5. Multiple spec-documents bind to distinct acceptance groups

**Splitting a file must not split a contract.**

- Sibling spec-documents must not declare overlapping contract group sets, and one acceptance group is never split across files to evade the cap.
- When a fractal has more than one spec-document, it has a DETAIL document.
- Each spec-document declares at least one existing DETAIL acceptance group through the adapter-recognized `filid:contract <group-id>` marker.

Ask yourself: "Which acceptance group does this file answer for — and does a sibling claim the same one?"

---

**This rule is working if:** every verification file's role is obvious from its content; case counts are derivable without running anything; a split file still maps to exactly one acceptance group. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the file is a throwaway probe that will never land in version control — then no cap applies, because there is no contract to keep.

# Code Placement

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > filid defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

Where a unit sits decides who may reach it, which makes placement a boundary decision rather than a filing decision. These rules govern where shared code goes, and what a restructure must prove before and after it runs. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: a unit has a location, and its consumers have locations too.

**Tradeoff:** moving code to its lowest common fractal creates churn today to remove a boundary violation permanently — prefer the move at a natural seam, not mid-task. **Applies when:** you are adding a unit with more than one consumer, or moving one.

## 1. Shared code sits at the lowest common fractal of its consumers

**The consumers' common ancestor is the address; anything higher is a guess.**

- Compute the lowest common fractal of the consumer owners, and place the unit under it.
- A single-consumer internal unit defaults to an organ of that owner — one consumer is not shared code.
- A unit with an independent public contract becomes a child fractal instead, with its intent, detail and entry-point artifacts.

Ask yourself: "Who consumes this — and what is the nearest fractal that contains all of them?"

## 2. An organ cannot be a lowest common ancestor

**An organ has no entry point, so it cannot own a shared boundary.**

- When the computed ancestor is an organ, walk up to the nearest enclosing fractal and place it there.

Ask yourself: "Is the target I picked a fractal, or a compartment inside one?"

## 3. No evidence for a name means a decision is required, not invented

**`shared` and `common` are names that can hold anything.**

- When no meaningful organ name is supported by the evidence, the plan sets `requiresDecision: true` and stops for a human.
- Do not invent a grab-bag name to let the plan proceed.

Ask yourself: "Does the evidence name this group, or am I naming it to get unblocked?"

## 4. Planning is read-only; the postcondition demands the exact target

**A functionally working but different result is a failed restructure.**

- A plan reports normalized absolute source and target paths, basis, consumers, the computed ancestor, required artifacts, import rewrites and decision reasons. It may write only an ephemeral plan artifact.
- A precondition checks the snapshot hash immediately before execution.
- A postcondition checks the exact target, the source's absence, the node type, documents, entry point, import boundary, required rewrites and the acyclic graph.
- A restructure tool plans and validates; an external actor performs the change.

Ask yourself: "If the code works but landed one directory over, does my check catch it?"

## 5. The document changes before the code does

**Contracts lead; implementations follow.**

Before implementation that touches a fractal:

- Identify every affected fractal.
- Update each affected DETAIL contract, and INTENT when a public interface or boundary changes.
- For new behavior or a fix, write a check and watch it fail for the intended reason.
- Implement the minimum change.
- Run scoped verification and the structural scan — warnings count as findings.
- Record the result and any deviation from the plan before moving to the next review seam.

Ask yourself: "Did the contract change before the code, or am I about to write it up afterwards?"

---

**This rule is working if:** shared units sit at an ancestor you can derive from their consumers; restructures land on the exact planned path; DETAIL diffs precede the implementation diffs they describe. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the unit has exactly one consumer and always will — then it belongs beside that consumer, and none of this applies.

# Agent-Legible Code

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

Code is read by agents and newcomers who hold no tribal memory: what a file does not show, they guess. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: code lives in files with names and paths, and symbols are defined and referenced.

**Applies when:** the change is intended to land in version control.

## 1. State the invisible wiring

**When behavior is bound by position, name, or registration — write down where the binding lives.**

- Name the mechanism in one line at the file's entry (or its module doc): `loaded by <mechanism>; <path/name/annotation> determines <what>`.

Ask yourself: "Could a reader with only this file and its imports predict when this code runs?"

## 2. Give every repeated block a unique anchor

**In repetitive structures, order is not an address.**

- Give each near-identical instance a distinct handle — a name, a key, or an adjacent marker unique to it; across copies (source vs generated), state which one is canonical.

Ask yourself: "If I asked someone to edit the third block, could they pick the wrong one?"

## 3. Defuse name traps

**When a name will mislead, fix the name — or post a warning where the misleading happens.**

- Prefer renaming toward the convention; when that is out of scope, one line at the point of confusion: `entry point is <X>, not <Y>`.

Ask yourself: "What would someone reasonably assume from this name — and is that assumption true?"

## 4. Prefer the direct reference

**When a direct call and an indirect mechanism are equally capable, choose direct.**

- Indirection the architecture or framework demands is not yours to remove — label it (rule 1) and move on.

Ask yourself: "Can a reader follow this reference with plain text search?"

## 5. Keep one unit graspable in one sitting

**A unit should be understandable alone: purpose from its name and head, dependencies from its imports, effect from its exports.**

- When one file needs several others open at once, split it or localize what it depends on.

Ask yourself: "Can I state what this file does without opening a second file?"

---

**This rule is working if:** edits land on the intended instance on the first attempt; a new file's run-conditions can be stated from the file alone; plain text search finds a feature's wiring. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the indirection you want to remove IS the framework — label framework conventions and leave them standing.

# Public Contract

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

What a module exports is a promise to every present and future consumer. This rule rests on a property every codebase with a module system has: a distinction exists between what is public and what is internal.

**Applies when:** the language or module system in use has an export or visibility mechanism.

## 1. Export only what has a consumer

**An export with no consumer carries a stated intent — or gets removed.**

- Remove leftover your change added or orphaned; leave a pre-existing one for a deliberate cleanup (`seiri_reuse-first` §3). Usage is tool-checkable; intent you must write.

Ask yourself: "Who consumes this — and if no one yet, where did I say so?"

## 2. Name every re-export

**A contract you cannot enumerate is not a contract.**

- Wildcard re-exports hide the surface three ways: a new symbol in an internal file silently widens the contract; duplicate names across re-exported files drop silently; and text tools lose the symbol list at the boundary. Entry points list what they export, by name.

Ask yourself: "Can I read the public surface without resolving a wildcard?"

## 3. Entry points declare, internals implement

**The set of symbols reachable from the entry point IS the public contract; everything behind it is free to change.**

- An entry point holds re-exports and wiring, not implementation; consumers outside the module hold only entry-point symbols.

Ask yourself: "If I renamed every internal file, would any consumer break?"

## 4. Framework-invoked files are entry points too

**A file the framework calls by convention is public surface, even though no import names it.**

- Routes, pages, handlers, plugin manifests: treat changes to their exported shape as contract changes, and label the convention that invokes them (`seiri_agent-legible` §1).

Ask yourself: "What breaks at runtime if I change this export's shape — and would any import have warned me?"

---

**This rule is working if:** the public surface can be enumerated by reading entry points; removing an internal symbol breaks no consumer; review diffs show contract changes as changed lines in an export list. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the code is a single-file script or notebook with no module boundary — there is no contract to keep small.

# Test Validity

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

A passing test is evidence only if it could have failed. These rules define when a test counts as verification. This rule rests on a property every codebase has: a means of verification exists and can be run.

**Tradeoff:** one extra verification step per test, in exchange for tests that mean something. **Applies when:** the change is intended to land in version control.

## 1. Fail first, then fix

**A fix's test is valid only if it fails without the fix — for the bug's reason.**

- Before finishing a bug fix, run its test against the pre-fix code and watch it fail. Use a scoped mechanism (revert locally, stash only the changed files, or a scratch worktree) — never disturb unrelated work.
- The failure must be the bug's symptom — not a setup error, a wrong path, or a missing import. When the fix introduces a new symbol, the expected pre-fix failure IS that symbol's absence.
- Refactors invert the contract: existing tests MUST pass unmodified before and after. Pin current behavior with added characterization tests BEFORE moving code — adding tests is fine; editing existing assertions is not.

Ask yourself: "Have I watched this test fail for the reason the bug exists?"

## 2. Verify the artifact you changed

**Verification against the wrong build always passes.**

- Use this repository's own designated verification command — the one its instructions or tooling name. Wrappers carry environment, build steps, and flags that raw tools lack; a raw-tool pass is diagnostic, never the final evidence.
- Confirm the harness exercises your modified code — not a stale build, an installed copy, or a cached artifact. If unsure, break your change deliberately once in a unit-scoped check and revert the probe: the run must go red. If it stays green, you are testing some other copy.

Ask yourself: "Is this command exercising the code I just edited?"

## 3. A snapshot is a claim, not a recording

**A snapshot captured from buggy code certifies the bug.**

- A regenerated snapshot is an assertion you are authoring. Read the diff; be able to defend every changed line, or do not commit it.
- Never regenerate snapshots to turn a run green without stating, in the diff or the change description, why the new output is the correct output.

Ask yourself: "Can I defend every changed line of this snapshot?"

## 4. Skips are loud

**A silent skip reports PASSED.**

- A test that cannot run in the current environment is a skip with a reason string, through the harness's own skip mechanism. A bare early return or a commented-out assertion converts a missing test into a green one.

Ask yourself: "If this test silently stopped testing, would anyone know?"

## 5. Every clause of a fix is load-bearing

**For each clause of your fix, some test must break when it is removed.**

- Delete each load-bearing clause (mentally or actually): at least one test must go red for each. A clause no test requires is untested or unnecessary.
- The same check applies to defensive code in module internals: a guard no internal path can reach is scope creep in a safety vest. Trust-boundary validation (public APIs, user input, external data) is exempt — exported symbols cannot enumerate their callers.

Ask yourself: "Which test breaks if I remove this line?"

## 6. Tests are curated, not accumulated

**A suite that only ever grows is drifting toward noise.**

- If this repository declares a per-file or per-suite limit, follow that limit. Otherwise apply the direction only: a test file that keeps growing is a signal to split by behavior or to merge duplicates into a parameterized form.
- Never delete or omit a needed test to satisfy tidiness — coverage outranks curation. Curate by merging and splitting, not by discarding.

Ask yourself: "Is this file accumulating cases, or organizing them?"

---

**This rule is working if:** your tests fail before your fixes and pass after; snapshot diffs are explained; skipped tests say why; deleting any part of a fix turns something red. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the code is a throwaway spike that will never be committed — then remember only that a test you never saw fail proves nothing either way.

# Reuse First

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

The best code for this repository usually already exists in it. This rule rests on a property every codebase has: a change is a diff, and it answers a request.

**Applies when:** the change is intended to land in version control.

## 1. Search first, compose second, write last

**Evaluate solutions in this strict order:**

1. **Reuse** existing shared code — utilities, helpers, modules already here, or libraries already installed.
2. **Extend safely** — additive only: optional parameters, new exports, wrappers. Preserve current behavior; no silent semantic change to an existing interface.
3. **Mirror the closest proven pattern** in this repository — unless it is clearly outdated or defective; then say so rather than copy it.
4. **Adopt the ecosystem-standard approach** — official documentation and maintainer guidance over ad-hoc examples.
5. **Write new code** — when the problem is genuinely novel here.

Ask yourself: "Does this already exist somewhere I haven't searched?"

## 2. The smallest code that answers the request

**Nothing speculative.**

- Validation at trust boundaries (public APIs, user input, external data) is never speculative — exported symbols cannot enumerate their callers.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior reviewer call this overbuilt?"

## 3. Surgical changes

**Every changed line traces to the request.**

- Remove what YOUR change orphaned; leave pre-existing dead code in place, mentioned, not buried in an unrelated diff.

Ask yourself: "Can I map each changed line back to the request?"

## 4. Work toward a verifiable goal

**Restate the task as something checkable before you start.**

- "Add validation" becomes "these invalid inputs are rejected, shown by a failing-then-passing check"; "fix the bug" becomes "a reproduction exists, then passes".

Ask yourself: "How will I know — mechanically — that I am done?"

## 5. One file, one responsibility

**A file answers for one thing.**

- If naming the file honestly needs "and", it is two files.

Ask yourself: "If this file grows one more export, should it split?"

---

**This rule is working if:** diffs read as direct answers to their requests; new code is hard to tell apart from the code around it; the utility you almost wrote turns out to already exist, found. **This rule is wrong for you if:** you are scaffolding a greenfield repository — there is nothing to reuse yet; apply §2 and §4 and return here once the first patterns exist.

# Naming

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

Names are the primary index of a codebase: what search finds, what imports show, what readers guess by. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: files and symbols have names, and an existing style is already present — whatever it is.

**Applies when:** the change is intended to land in version control.

## 1. Mirror the siblings

**Before naming anything, read the names around it.**

- Match the case, the grammar (verb-first or noun-first), the suffix, and the singular/plural habits of sibling files and symbols of the same kind. No siblings? The idiomatic form of the language or framework. A migration in progress? The declared target style, not the majority.

Ask yourself: "What style do my neighbors already use?"

## 2. A name states one concrete responsibility

**A reader should predict the content from the name alone.**

- Name by what the unit does or holds, not when it was added or who owns it. An honest name that needs "and" is two units (`seiri_reuse-first` §5); a vague honest name means a vague responsibility — fix the unit.

Ask yourself: "Reading only this name, what would I expect inside — and is that what's inside?"

## 3. No grab-bags

**Names that can hold anything end up holding everything.**

- Avoid `common`, `misc`, `util2`, `temp`, `new`, `stuff`, `extra` and their kin — they defeat search and accrete unrelated content. Three helpers for date math are `date-math`, not `helpers2`.

Ask yourself: "Could a stranger guess what does NOT belong in this file?"

## 4. Derived names follow their source

**A file that exists because of another carries that other's base name.**

- Tests, specs, fixtures, and generated companions are named for what they verify or accompany, and rename with their source — a base name that matches nothing is a name trap (`seiri_agent-legible` §3).

Ask yourself: "From this file's name, can I find the file it serves?"

---

**This rule is working if:** you can locate a feature by guessing its name; new files look native to their directory; a rename never leaves orphaned companions behind. **This rule is wrong for you if:** a generator names these files — then the generator's convention IS the sibling convention; configure the generator, don't fight its output.

# Structure

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

Structure is the cost model of reading: every hop, level, and cycle is paid by whoever comes next. This rule states directions only — where this repository (or its architecture tooling) declares concrete limits, those limits win. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: files have sizes and paths, and symbols reference one another.

**Tradeoff:** structural moves (splits, extractions) create churn today to reduce reading cost tomorrow; prefer them at natural seams, not mid-task. **Applies when:** the change is intended to land in version control.

## 1. Dependencies form a DAG

**A cycle is two units pretending to be one.**

- When A needs B and B needs A, no reading order exists: extract the shared piece into a third unit, invert one edge behind an interface or event, or merge the two honestly.
- Do not certify acyclicity by tooling you have not run; trace the edges you touched.

Ask yourself: "Can I order these units so every reference points one way?"

## 2. Depth is a toll

**Nest to expose structure, not to file things away.**

- Every directory level is a hop a reader pays on every visit. If this repository declares a depth limit, follow it; otherwise apply the direction: when following one call chain means descending many levels, flatten.
- A directory with one child is a corridor, not a room — collapse it.

Ask yourself: "Does each level of this path tell the reader something?"

## 3. Cohesion splits, complexity compresses

**Two different smells, two different moves.**

- When parts of a unit do not share state or purpose, the unit is several units: split it. If this repository (or its architecture tooling) declares a cohesion measure and threshold, follow those; otherwise split where the seams already show.
- When one unit branches beyond what a reader can simulate, compress: extract steps, replace condition ladders with tables or dispatch, name the phases. If a complexity threshold is declared, follow it; otherwise let "can I simulate this in my head?" be the trigger.

Ask yourself: "Am I looking at two things glued, or one thing tangled?"

## 4. Growth is a signal

**A file that keeps growing is announcing a boundary.**

- If this repository declares a file-size limit, follow it. Otherwise apply the direction: recurring growth in one file means a responsibility wants out — split along the responsibility seam, not at an arbitrary line count.

Ask yourself: "What part of this file keeps attracting changes — and is it the same part I opened it for?"

---

**This rule is working if:** following a call chain rarely reverses direction; finding code takes few hops; splits land at seams reviewers recognize without explanation. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the tree is vendored or generated — a generator owns that structure; change the generator or leave it be (see `seiri_context-efficiency` §1).

# Function Boundaries

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

A function is the smallest unit a reader can hold whole — and the cheapest one to get wrong, because the cost lands on its callers. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: functions take inputs and produce outputs, and they live in files with names.

**Tradeoff:** purity moves effects, it does not remove them — a program that touches nothing does nothing. Push effects outward until they sit in one named place, not until every layer needs a wrapper. **Applies when:** you are writing or moving a function.

## 1. Inputs arrive as parameters

**The signature is the full list of what a function can see.**

- Compute from arguments. Module state read at call time, ambient config, the clock, the environment: passed in, not reached for.
- When a dependency genuinely cannot be passed — a framework injects it, a runtime owns it — say so at the function or its file head (`seiri_agent-legible` §1) instead of reaching through it silently.

Ask yourself: "Given the same arguments, does this return the same thing?"

## 2. Effects live at the edge

**Pure by default; effectful on purpose, in one named place.**

- I/O, module-state writes, mutation of what the caller owns: keep them in functions whose names announce them, called from the outer layer — not sprinkled through the computation they serve.
- Mutating an argument is an unwritten output. Return the new value, or make the mutation the function's stated purpose.
- A function that both computes and persists is two functions and a caller.

Ask yourself: "If this ran twice, what would differ the second time — and does the name warn me?"

## 3. One file, one exported function

**The file name is the export list.**

- Name a function file for the function it exports, and export that one only (`seiri_naming` §4). A second export earns its place only when the two cannot be read apart.
- At most two unexported helpers may share the file, and each helper's implementation body must be 8 lines or fewer; its declaration or signature and enclosing braces do not count. A longer helper is its own file (`seiri_structure` §3).
- At most three types, newly defined here. Derived types — aliases, narrowings, unions over what already exists — stay with their source. Type-only files (`types.ts`, `types/`) are outside this budget.
- These counts are defaults; a budget this repository declares wins.

Ask yourself: "Can I name what this file exports without opening it — and can I find every caller by searching that one name?"

## 4. A helper that moves out moves down

**Extraction is not relocation to the same shelf.**

- Helpers pulled out of a function do not become its flat neighbors: give the function a directory and file them one level under it, in a satellite called `utils/` or `helpers/` while its only claim is "these serve the function above" — named for the topic once the set has one (`seiri_naming` §3).
- The path states which function is served and which serves. A row of peers states nothing (`seiri_structure` §2).

Ask yourself: "From the path alone, can I tell the entry point from its helpers?"

---

**This rule is working if:** tests call functions without building a world first; a file's imports stay countable at a glance; the caller of a helper sits one directory up, every time. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the framework owns the unit — components, route handlers, and generated clients follow their framework's shape; apply §1 and §2 inside them and leave the file layout to the convention.

# Context Efficiency

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

Context is the scarcest resource in an agent session: performance degrades as it fills, and every wasted read crowds out instructions already given. This rule rests on a property of every session, not of any codebase: context is finite, and reading spends it.

**Tradeoff:** these rules bias toward fewer, more deliberate reads. When genuinely disoriented, one broad read beats three wrong guesses. **Applies when:** you are an agent operating on a repository.

## 1. Generated artifacts are search-only

**Build output is not source. Fix generators, not their output.**

- Generated output (build directories, compiled bundles, coverage reports, generated clients): search it to trace a symbol; do not read it wholesale; never edit it. An edit there disappears on the next build — and a bug found there may already be fixed in its source.
- Installed dependencies and lockfiles are a different class: dependency sources and type definitions are canonical references — read them when the dependency's contract is the question. Never hand-edit a lockfile; change the manifest and regenerate through the package manager.
- When a generated file is wrong, the deliverable is a change to its generator or template.

Ask yourself: "Would this file survive a clean build?"

## 2. Capture once, read from the file

**Re-running a command to re-read its output pays twice.**

- Never re-run the same long command just to grep its output differently. Capture once to a scratch file outside the repository tree, then search and re-read from that file. Repo-root log files pollute status and reviews.
- A capture goes stale the moment relevant code changes — re-run after edits; judging a post-fix state from a pre-fix capture is self-deception. Investigating flaky behavior is the legitimate reason for repeated runs.

Ask yourself: "Did I already have this output and throw it away?"

## 3. Re-reads need a reason

**Change, external modification, or genuine doubt — not habit.**

- Do not re-read what has not changed. After compaction or a long session, re-reading before an edit is a reason — habit is not.
- Read the range the task needs; a targeted read plus a follow-up beats loading whole files by default.
- Before broad exploration, state what you are looking for; stop when you find it — after confirming it is the only candidate. A first match is not proof of uniqueness.

Ask yourself: "What new fact will this read give me that the last one didn't?"

---

**This rule is working if:** generated directories never appear in your edits; long outputs are quoted from capture files; every re-read can name its reason. **This rule is wrong for you if:** you have lost orientation — take the one broad read, reorient, and return to targeted reads.

# Cognitive Discipline

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

Behavioral guardrails against rationalization in long agent sessions. This rule rests on a property of every session, not of any codebase: a claim about code can be checked against the code and its oracles — text you generate is not evidence.

**Tradeoff:** verification over speed. For a trivial task you may scale a check down — but only out loud: name the check you are skipping and why. A silent skip is the failure mode this rule exists to block. **Applies when:** you are an agent operating on a repository.

## 1. Evidence over confidence

**Don't claim. Verify — with this repository's own oracles — then cite.**

- A claim without observable evidence is a prediction. Observable means tool output, test results, file contents — not your reasoning about them.
- Each quality attribute needs its own evidence: a linter pass is not a build; one test is not the suite; a path recalled from memory is a guess until a tool confirms it exists.

Ask yourself: "What observable output backs this sentence?"

## 2. Causes, not symptoms

**Fix where it started, not where it surfaced.**

- Where an error appears and where it lives are usually different places. "I see the problem, let me fix it" almost always means you see the symptom.
- Repeated failure of the same approach indicts the approach. When each fix reveals a new problem elsewhere, stop patching and question the underlying assumption.

Ask yourself: "Am I patching where it broke, or where it started?"

## 3. Read before you adapt

**Skimming a pattern produces a misapplied pattern.**

- Fully read what you copy or adapt. Navigation may stay targeted; comprehension of what you reuse may not.
- Simple tasks bypass the scrutiny complex ones attract — which is exactly how simple tasks break things. "Too simple to check" is a rationalization, not an assessment.

Ask yourself: "Have I read the whole reference, or am I pattern-matching its shape?"

## 4. The letter is the spirit

**"While I'm at it" is scope creep. Sunk cost is not value.**

- When a rule or request names a concrete action, the concrete action is required — "I followed the spirit" is how the letter gets skipped.
- The requested scope is the entire scope; propose extras separately.
- Work already done has no claim on being kept. When the approach is wrong, discard it — adaptation inherits the defect.

Ask yourself: "Is this in scope, or am I justifying creep?"

## 5. Honest over agreeable

**Disagree with reasoning; say "I don't know" instead of guessing.**

- Reflexive agreement is not analysis. Restate the requirement, ask, or push back with grounds.
- Shipping work you are unsure of without disclosure is deception by omission. Disclosed uncertainty plus a check that would catch the failure is the acceptable form of proceeding.

Ask yourself: "Am I agreeing because it's correct, or because it's expected?"

## Red flags — stop and verify

Saying "probably / should / seems to" about your own change · declaring success without fresh output · a fix touching the same symptom a second time · wanting the task to be over.

**This rule is working if:** claims cite tool output; pushback comes with reasoning; fixes do not reappear in new places; skipped checks are skipped out loud. **This rule is wrong for you if:** never — but its checks scale down out loud for trivial work; what never scales down is saying so.

# Code Comments

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults. On conflict, the higher source wins and this rule yields.

A comment is the one thing in a file nothing checks: no compiler reads it, no test goes red when it lies — and it is believed anyway. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: the language provides a form for comments, and a comment sits beside the code it describes.

**Tradeoff:** a documentation comment per declaration is lines you must keep true as the code moves, in exchange for a surface readers and the language's own tooling can consume without opening the body. **Applies when:** the change is intended to land in version control.

## 1. A comment states the current spec, never its history

**When the code changes, its comment changes in the same edit.**

- No changelog lines, no dated notes, no "previously" or "used to", no commented-out predecessor kept for reference. Nothing verifies any of it, so it rots silently and then misleads with the authority of a comment.
- History that must be kept goes where this repository keeps it — the version-control trail, a changelog, a decision record, a module document beside the code. Not in the source.
- An edit that leaves a comment behind has published a false statement. Change the behavior, rewrite the sentence describing the old one; delete the code, delete its comment with it.

Ask yourself: "Reading only this comment, would I describe the code as it is today?"

## 2. A function's documentation comment names its parameters, its result, and its purpose

**The signature says what the types are; the comment says what they mean.**

- Write it in the documentation-comment form the language provides — the one its own tooling and editors already read — and fill every slot that form defines: each parameter, what comes back, and what the function is for.
- Say what the caller cannot see from the signature: what makes an argument valid, the conditions under which the call fails, the effect it has beyond its return value.
- Do not restate the signature in prose. A parameter documented as "the id" earned nothing; a parameter documented by what makes it acceptable earned its line.

Ask yourself: "Does this comment tell a caller something the signature could not?"

## 3. Every declaration the form reaches carries one

**Documentation comments are not a function-only convention.**

- Types, fields, members, constants, modules — wherever the language's documentation form applies and its tooling would render the result, the declaration carries a comment in that form.
- Say what the declaration is for and how it is meant to be used. A name repeated as a sentence adds a line and no information.
- The scope is the declarations the documentation form reaches. A local inside a body is not one of them — when it needs explaining, a truer name or a split is the fix, not a comment.

Ask yourself: "If a reader met this declaration through generated docs or an editor tooltip, would they know how to use it?"

## 4. Follow the language's own comment convention; do not invent one

**A house format nobody's tooling reads is a private dialect every newcomer has to learn.**

- Take the form from the language and the siblings around the file — its documentation comment, its inline comment, its placement relative to the declaration. This rule fixes no format of its own.
- An inline comment sits at the code it explains, not in a banner that drifts away from it.
- A note some other convention of this repository asks you to leave — where invisible wiring is bound, a warning where a name misleads, a dependency the signature cannot show — is a comment like any other: it takes this form, and §1 keeps it current.

Ask yourself: "Would this comment look native in any other file of this repository?"

---

**This rule is working if:** a reader trusts a comment without checking the body against it; a caller can use a function from its documentation comment alone; the past tense lives in the history, never in the source. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the language has no documentation-comment convention and the repository has not adopted one — then §1 still binds, and the rest has no form to follow.
