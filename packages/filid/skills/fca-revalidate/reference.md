| Fix Type            | Verification Tool                    | Pass Condition         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| LCOM4 violation     | `ast_analyze(lcom4)`                 | LCOM4 < 2              |
| CC violation        | `ast_analyze(cyclomatic-complexity)` | CC <= 15               |
| 3+12 violation      | `test_metrics(check-312)`            | All files PASS         |
| Structure violation | `structure_validate`                 | No violations          |
| Circular dependency | `ast_analyze(dependency-graph)`      | No cycles              |
| Drift               | `drift_detect`                       | No drift               |

## Non-Negotiable Rules (Constitutional)

These rules cannot be deferred via justification. Any justification
attempting to defer these is marked UNCONSTITUTIONAL:

1. **Hardcoded secrets/credentials** — always FAIL
2. **Circular dependencies** — always FAIL
3. **Security vulnerabilities** (injection, auth bypass) — always FAIL

## Debt Resolution Criteria

A debt item is considered resolved when:

1. The file at `debt.file_path` was modified in the Delta
2. The violated rule is re-verified and now passes
3. Both conditions must be true for `debt_manage(resolve)` to execute

Partial resolution is not supported (1 debt = 1 rule violation).
