# bridge/ is a build output (from esbuild) but intentionally NOT gitignored.
# Plugin consumers need pre-built bridge files (MCP server + hook entry points)
# to function without running a build step. Unlike dist/ (library exports),
# bridge/ files are runtime entry points referenced by hooks.json and .mcp.json.
