## Overview

**Ogham** is a monorepo for Claude Code plugins and AI-powered developer tools. Everything is built with TypeScript. The repo hosts plugins that extend Claude Code agent behavior — from automated project structure management to multi-persona code reviews.

---

## Monorepo Structure

This repository hosts multiple packages with independent versioning and distribution:

- **Claude plugins** — installed and used inside [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (or compatible hosts) to extend agent behavior.

Each package has its own `README.md` with usage, dependencies, and examples.
