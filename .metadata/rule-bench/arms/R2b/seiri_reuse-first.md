# Reuse First

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. The best code for this repository usually already exists in it. This rule rests on a property every codebase has: a change is a diff, and it answers a request. Applies when the change will land in version control.

## 1. Search first, compose second, write last

**Evaluate solutions in this strict order:**

1. **Reuse** existing shared code — utilities, helpers, modules already here, or libraries already installed.
2. **Extend safely** — additive only: optional parameters, new exports, wrappers. Preserve current behavior; no silent semantic change to an existing interface.
3. **Mirror the closest proven pattern** in this repository — unless it is clearly outdated or defective; then say so rather than copy it.
4. **Adopt the ecosystem-standard approach** — official documentation and maintainer guidance over ad-hoc examples.
5. **Write new code** — when the problem is genuinely novel here.

## 2. The smallest code that answers the request

**Nothing speculative.** Validation at trust boundaries (public APIs, user input, external data) is never speculative — exported symbols cannot enumerate their callers.

## 3. Surgical changes

**Every changed line traces to the request.** Remove what YOUR change orphaned; leave pre-existing dead code in place, mentioned, not buried in an unrelated diff.

## 4. Work toward a verifiable goal

**Restate the task as something checkable before you start:** "add validation" becomes "these invalid inputs are rejected, shown by a failing-then-passing check"; "fix the bug" becomes "a reproduction exists, then passes".

## 5. One file, one responsibility

**A file answers for one thing.** If naming it honestly needs "and", it is two files.

---

**This rule is working if:** diffs read as direct answers to their requests, and the utility you almost wrote turns out to already exist, found. **This rule is wrong for you if:** you are scaffolding a greenfield repository — there is nothing to reuse yet; apply §2 and §4 and return here once the first patterns exist.
