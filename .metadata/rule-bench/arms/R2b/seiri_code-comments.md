# Code Comments

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. A comment is the one thing in a file nothing checks: no compiler reads it, no test goes red when it lies — and it is believed anyway. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: the language provides a form for comments, and a comment sits beside the code it describes. Applies when the change will land in version control.

## 1. A comment states the current spec, never its history

**When the code changes, its comment changes in the same edit.** No changelog lines, no dated notes, no "previously" or "used to", no commented-out predecessor kept for reference — nothing verifies any of it, so it rots silently and then misleads with the authority of a comment. History that must be kept goes where this repository keeps it (the version-control trail, a changelog, a decision record, a module document) — never the source. Delete the code, delete its comment with it: a comment left behind is a published false statement.

## 2. A function's documentation comment names its parameters, its result, and its purpose

**Write it in the documentation-comment form the language provides, and fill every slot that form defines:** each parameter, what comes back, and what the function is for. Say what the caller cannot see from the signature — what makes an argument valid, the conditions under which the call fails, the effect it has beyond its return value. Do not restate the signature in prose: a parameter documented as "the id" earned nothing.

## 3. Every declaration the form reaches carries one

**Types, fields, members, constants, modules — wherever the language's documentation form applies and its tooling would render the result, the declaration carries a comment that says what it is for and how it is meant to be used.** A local inside a body is not one of them: when it needs explaining, a truer name or a split is the fix, not a comment.

## 4. Follow the language's own comment convention; do not invent one

**Take the form from the language and the siblings around the file — its documentation comment, its inline comment, its placement relative to the declaration.** An inline comment sits at the code it explains, not in a banner that drifts away from it. A note some other convention asks you to leave — invisible wiring, a name-trap warning, an unpassable dependency — is a comment like any other: it takes this form, and §1 keeps it current.

---

**This rule is working if:** a reader trusts a comment without checking the body against it, and the past tense lives in the history, never in the source. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the language has no documentation-comment convention and the repository has not adopted one — then §1 still binds, and the rest has no form to follow.
