# Agent-Legible Code

> **Precedence**: repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, project rules) > repository conventions > this rule > seiri defaults — the higher source wins. Code is read by agents and newcomers with no tribal memory: what a file does not show, they guess. This rule rests on properties every codebase has: code lives in files with names and paths, and symbols are defined and referenced. Applies when the change will land in version control.

## 1. State the invisible wiring

**When behavior is bound by position, name, or registration, name the mechanism in one line at the file's entry (or its module doc):** `loaded by <mechanism>; <path/name/annotation> determines <what>`.

## 2. Give every repeated block a unique anchor

**In repetitive structures, order is not an address.** Give each near-identical instance a distinct handle — a name, a key, or an adjacent marker unique to it; across copies (source vs generated), state which one is canonical.

## 3. Defuse name traps

**When a name will mislead, rename toward the convention; when that is out of scope, post one line at the point of confusion:** `entry point is <X>, not <Y>`.

## 4. Prefer the direct reference

**When a direct call and an indirect mechanism are equally capable, choose direct — a reader should be able to follow the reference with plain text search.** Indirection the architecture or framework demands is not yours to remove: label it (§1) and move on.

## 5. Keep one unit graspable in one sitting

**A unit should be understandable alone:** purpose from its name and head, dependencies from its imports, effect from its exports. When one file needs several others open at once, split it or localize what it depends on.

---

**This rule is working if:** edits land on the intended instance on the first attempt, and plain text search finds a feature's wiring. **This rule is wrong for you if:** the indirection you want to remove IS the framework — label it and leave it standing.
